subversion it all
"drop macguffin then n then take macguffin" works. We should execute the steps in between each parse attempt instead of reading the chain.
put macguffin in leaves: leaves don't complain about being too small to hide the macguffin
moving things without picking them up
 + move leaves north
 + move leaves through door
 + push pile north
 + push pile through door
 + push pile into door
change the way announcements work so that you instead do Broadcast(@AnnounceShaken, Perspective);
 + then implement shaking
 + then implement dancing
tools to shape the world - digging - forming a tunnel... if digging in a tunnel without moving dirt away, encloses you in
 + fill hole with pile of leaves
you can move something onto something else even if that other thing is on something that couldn't handle the new total mass or volume. should we handle his via HandleAdd()? (take macguffin; have someone else walk onto it)
When you're being carried by someone and you drop something, it ends up inside them. It should drop out of them.
taking something with things on it should make the things fall off
support "it". In particular, if "look" only mentions one thing, "take it" should work.
exit things by name
 - "leave leaves", "exit leaves": I don't understand how to exit "leaves".
 - "get out of pile": That's a direction, I don't know how to take it.
"The player arrives from the hut." when another player is seen exiting the hut: would be better if it said "The player leaves the hut"?
it says "Carinda enters Camp Cuddlyfort. Carinda arrives from you." when another player is leaving you
"climb [up]", "climb down" commands; "jump" command ("jump up", "jump on the spot"); "jump down" command; "up" should imply "climb"; "down" should imply "climb down" if there's something to climb with, otherwise "jump down"; climbing should only work if the relevant FUp/FDown is a TThing that is flagged as climbable
"climb cliff": I don't understand how to "climb".
"jump into pile of leaves"; jumping into a pile should scatter it (remove psTidy from its FState)
"take macguffin then move me to leaves then drop macguffin" parses as "drop macguffin on ground", not "drop macguffin on leaves"
password command
player safe where they can keep things while disconnected
player savepoint so that players can reappear in a specific place after disconnecting
throwing
- "throw MacGuffin north": I don't understand how to "throw".
"Take a carinda" to take just one.
"take all from pile", "take all in pile" should work
make shout broadcast to surrounding rooms
"move to north", "move to hut"
announce when a player disconnects or reconnects
If you send too much data at once, the socket's write buffer is filled, which causes the socket to have an exception (ETryAgain), which causes the game to abort.
Sometimes the server just dies silently (killed by the kernel?).
tools to shape the world - walking through the forest autocreating more forest, fields, rivers, mountains, caves
tools to shape the world - cutting down the forest to form fields, piles of wood
tools to shape the world - making small huts from piles of wood
Players should have PartOfs: eyes, hands, etc
Players should have Implicits: "you", "time" ("take time"), etc
Outdoor rooms can all point FUp to a TSky owned by the World, which itself can have a TSun which could go up and down maybe also a TMoon... and TStars...)
make sure FUp doesn't have to be in FChildren... maybe TSky is a TLocation instead?
Looking should check for illumination by walking all the objects (FUp-not-in-FChildren would need special treatment... maybe some TLocations can contribute light?)
- light contribution depends on Subject and Perspective
- light is PitchBlack, Dark, Lit; stop walking after getting Lit
- also check for FChildren that block Visibility from Perspective to Subject (e.g. smoke, fog)
well-worn paths: outdoor wild locations should count how many people have walked on them and should start describing themselves as paths
move build.sh options to a configuration file
TPile.CanTake() should hint if there's something in the pile. "Your fingers brush against something metalic." -- all things would need a GetDescriptionAdjective() or something
