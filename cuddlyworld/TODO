NEXT
 + change the way parsing is done so that each thing is asked how many words it can match and then the longest reply is taken as the actual length of the match
 + make the synonyms thing support multiple words per synonym, the words having to appear in the given order (or else figure out whether to special case "of" in thing descriptions; also consider "south west arch" which should not be picked for the term "south arch")
 + "dilap..." should work as an adjective

PLOT
 + plot

WIZARDING
 + tools to shape the world - magic digging wand that doesn't make piles appear
 + tools to shape the world - walking through the forest autocreating more forest, fields, rivers, mountains, caves
 + tools to shape the world - cutting down the forest to form fields, piles of wood
 + tools to shape the world - making small huts from piles of wood
 + digging while in a hole - "dig ground" should at least do something while in a hole in the ground
 + "destroy mountain": I don't understand how to "destroy".
 + "delete leaves": I don't understand how to "delete".
 + "make vegetation": I don't understand how to "make".
 + "grow vegetation": I don't understand how to "grow".
 + "create axe": I don't understand how to "create".
 + "instantiate axe": I don't understand how to "instantiate".

NAVIGATION
 + exit things by name
    - "leave leaves", "exit leaves": I don't understand how to exit "leaves".
    - "get out of pile": That's a direction, I don't know how to take it.
    - when doing this make sure that we can't escape closed containers
 + "climb [up]", "climb down" commands; "jump" command ("jump up", "jump on the spot", "jump off cliff"); "jump down" command; "up" should imply "climb"; "down" should imply "climb down" if there's something to climb with, otherwise "jump down"; climbing should only work if the relevant FUp/FDown is a TThing that is flagged as climbable
 + "climb cliff": I don't understand how to "climb".
 + "jump into pile of leaves"; jumping into a pile should scatter it (remove psTidy from its FState)
 + "move to north", "move to hut"
 + "get on pile" should mean the same as "move onto pile"
 + "move off", "move off pile", "move me off pile" when standing on the pile of leaves
 + "off" and "get off" should be required to be used instead of "out" when on an object
 + announce when a player disconnects or reconnects
 + "look out" while on something on the ground talks about the ground. It should use the GetDefaultAtom() for the thing it's looking at
 + "exits"
 + seriously consider making it impossible for a TAvatar to be anything but tpOn
    - this would mean that any object that can be entered would have to have a separate surface inside
    - this would dramatically simplify navigation and looking around
    - this might be necessary to make descriptions from inside a bag make as much sense as outside a bag, anyway

PLAYER INTERACTION
 + if you "take all" when someone is present holding something, you take their stuff
 + "The player arrives from the hut." when another player is seen exiting the hut: would be better if it said "The player leaves the hut"? messages about in-room navigation are pretty poor in general right now (enter hole, enter pile, etc)
 + it says "Carinda enters Camp Cuddlyfort. Carinda arrives from you." when another player is leaving you
 + make shout broadcast to surrounding rooms
 + "hello <player>", "greet <player>"
 + "say to <player>, ..."
 + rescue people in holes when the hole is filled (see // note in THole.HandleAdd)
 + player safe where they can keep things while disconnected
 + player savepoint so that players can reappear in a specific place after disconnecting
 + "poke head out of leaves": I don't understand how to "poke".
 + "hide in leaves": I don't understand how to "hide". (should probably just be equivalent to getting into the leaves)
 + implement dancing, kissing, emoting in general
 + bounce balloon

THINGS
 + make orbs smaller but with no carrying capability
 + you can move something onto something else even if that other thing is on something that couldn't handle the new total mass or volume. should we handle his via HandleAdd()? (take macguffin; have someone else walk onto it); maybe handle this by chaining CanPut() and friends up the parent chain, but we should have objects HandleAdd unexpected stuff anyway, for when you fumble it (since that doesn't check to see if you can put it there)
 + you can probably push something out of a hole even if you can't push it into a hole; see "// xxx" in player.pas DoRemove
 + When you're being carried by someone and you drop something, it ends up inside them. It should drop out of them.
 + taking something with things on it should make the things fall off
 + throwing - "throw MacGuffin north": I don't understand how to "throw".
 + see whether "put x in ground" does things differently when the ground has a hole that is covered (see "// xxx" in things.pas TSurface.GetInside)
 + TPile.CanTake() should hint if there's something in the pile. "Your fingers brush against something metalic." -- all things would need a GetDescriptionAdjective() or something
 + digging a pile of earth should reveal all the things in the pile and put them on the ground next to the pile
 + "empty x" should be like "move all from x out"
 + "remove"
 + "put all in x" should look everywhere, not just in hands
 + "take bag then move leaves into bag then move leaves out of bag" fails because when you're holding the bag it doesn't think to push them onto the floor
 + "push leaves into bag; push leaves onto ground" - the second part fails because when you're holding the bag it is too far from the floor
 + support "it". In particular, if "look" only mentions one thing, "take it" should work.
 + support dangling parser - if we asked "which?" then accept a single GetThing() as a response (filtering only the previous matches) and resume parsing previous command
 + 'dig hole' should work
 + "fill hole" (with pile of earth) (by moving pile of earth into hole)
 + "push leaves into bag; push leaves out of bag" - the out of part fails (but "move out of" would work) - should be an avRemove
 + "Take a carinda" to take just one. "take a leaf" as a way to take a leaf from pile?
 + "take all from pile", "take all in pile", "move pile from hole to ground" should work - GetReferencedThings() should support the "from X", "in X" modifiers
    - "look at X Y" where Y is "to the north", "to n", "to north", "in the north", "in n", "in north"
 + "drop all but spade and sword" should work
 + "move all but inventory" should work
 + "move leaves through door", "push pile through door"
 + 'look under' should move things if they are bigger than what they are on
 + 'look' when inside an object that usually hides its contents (e.g. a pile) still hides its contents when in the pile - do we need FromOutside for GetDescriptionIn()?
 + "look closer" should ask what part you want to look closer at ("look closer" "what do you want to look closer at?" "look closer at tree" "do you want to examine the leaf, or the branch?"
 + "take all there is"
 + "take all again"
 + "take leaves with spade"
 + "put x under y" should say (by putting y on x) (first taking y)
 + "find a b c" if it finds several says "which c do you want to find", not "which a b c do you want to find".

NETWORK
 + password command
 + gender command / "i am male", "i am a robot", "i am a hive mind" / UI
 + If you send too much data at once, the socket's write buffer is filled, which causes the socket to have an exception (ETryAgain), which causes the game to abort.
 + Sometimes the server just dies silently (killed by the kernel?).

WORLD
 + Players should have PartOfs: eyes, hands, etc
 + Players should have Implicits: "you", "time" ("take time"), etc
 + Outdoor rooms can all point FUp to a TSky owned by the World, which itself can have a TSun which could go up and down maybe also a TMoon... and TStars...)
 + make sure FUp doesn't have to be in FChildren... maybe TSky is a TLocation instead? or use the global thing feature
 + well-worn paths: outdoor wild locations should count how many people have walked on them and should start describing themselves as paths
 + "harvest forest": I don't understand how to "harvest".
 + "chop down forest": I don't understand how to "chop".
 + "repair", "unbreak system": I don't understand how to "unbreak".

ILLUMINATION
 + Looking should check for illumination by walking all the objects (FUp-not-in-FChildren would need special treatment... maybe some TLocations can contribute light?)
    - light contribution depends on Subject and Perspective
    - light is PitchBlack, Dark, Lit; stop walking after getting Lit
    - also check for FChildren that block Visibility from Perspective to Subject (e.g. smoke, fog)

FOOD
 + "go eat": I don't understand how to go "eat".
 + "feed MacGuffin": I don't understand how to "feed".

CODE
 + move build.sh options to a configuration file
 + log exceptions other than parse errors - abstract out the logging code
 + see if it makes sense to change TThing.Navigate() and TThing.GetLookDirection() to instead use a GetAtomForDirection()-like approach
